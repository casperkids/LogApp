This LogApp was created using React/Vite. 
It is the final project for the Advanced course at Frauenloop! 

ðŸ¤–Robo LogðŸ¤–
The app serves as a tool for recording daily insights and memos, 
and each day with logged entries is marked as an Activity Log. Additionally, 
entering a title generates a corresponding robot. Users can collect various robots through this feature.
